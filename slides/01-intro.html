# Why study distribution shifts?

Species distributions are changing in response to climate, fishing pressure, and habitat changes

--

Management and conservation are aided by understanding how distributions are changing and may change in the future

--

Cross-border coordination requires understanding range-wide distributions

--

Shifting distributions can cross management boundaries, affecting quota allocations

---

### We have wonderful scientific surveys, but...

Surveys don't always cover the same areas every year

--

Sampling effort varies spatially and temporally

--

Even faithfully implemented random or random stratified designs introduce spatial sampling noise

--

We often want to combine multiple surveys

--

Different surveys may use different gear, vessels, or protocols

--

Raw survey catch data can't reliably tell us about true distribution changes vs. sampling artifacts

---

### Raw sampling data can confuse sampling changes with distribution changes

# The solution: model-based metrics

.large[
1. Fit a statistical spatiotemporal ("dynamic") species distribution model

2. Predict to a constant spatial grid
(standardizes for spatial, gear, and effort variation in sampling)

3. Calculate distribution metrics from those predictions with uncertainty

# Fitting a useful model

To calculate reliable distribution metrics, we need to understand how to fit models to large spatiotemporal survey datasets

--

Spatial data has challenges to modelling

--

Temporal data has challenges to modelling

--

Spatiotemporal data has *a lot* to think to think about when modelling

--

That's going to be the focus of much of this workshop

# Modelling spatial/spatiotemporal data

---

# Geostatistical data

We're focused on **geostatistical** data: observations of a continuous spatial process at georeferenced locations

--

I.e., we pick spatial coordinates to sample at and observe something, like the number or weight of fish (as opposed to "point process" data or "areal" data)

&lt;img src="01-intro_files/figure-html/field-samples-1.png" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Modelling spatial data

Data often have spatial attributes

Ideal world:
  1. Plug spatial covariates into a regression model
  2. Residuals are uncorrelated

&lt;img src="01-intro_files/figure-html/sim-rf-intro-1.png" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Reality

Residual spatial autocorrelation is pervasive.

--

Alternatively, there are unmodelled, missing, or "latent" spatially structured covariates

&lt;img src="01-intro_files/figure-html/sim-rf-intro-cor-1.png" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Why worry about these latent spatial variables?

1. Often they are of ecological interest

--

2. Ignoring them hurts our predictions

--

3. Ignoring them messes up our quantification of uncertainty

---

# Modeling latent spatial variables

Need a 'wiggly' surface for approximating all missing spatially structured variables

--

Several approaches exist. For example:
  * 2D smoothers with GAMs (e.g., mgcv)
  * Gaussian random fields
  * Random forests etc.

# Why focus on Gaussian random fields?

Random fields are nice because

--

1. They are very flexible in the shapes they can fit

--

2. They can be fit efficiently

--

3. They estimate ecologically interpretable parameters

# Random fields

A way of estimating a wiggly surface to account for spatial and/or spatiotemporal correlation in data.

--

Alternatively, a way of estimating a wiggly surface to account for unobserved spatially structured variables.

--

As a bonus, they provide useful parameter estimates: spatial variance (magnitude of wiggles) and the rate at which data become uncorrelated with distance (how smooth are the wiggles).

---

# Correlation/covariance functions

- These constrain the random field MVN distribution.

--

- They define how correlation decays with distance.

--

- Can be isotropic or anisotropic.

--

- Common choices: exponential, Gaussian, Matérn.

---

# Exponential correlation

$$
\mathcal{C}\left(d\right) = e^{ -d/\rho }
$$

- `\(d\)` is distance
- `\(\rho\)` controls the rate of correlation decay with distance

&lt;img src="01-intro_files/figure-html/exp-cov-1.png" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Gaussian or squared exponential correlation

$$
\mathcal{C}\left(d\right) = e^{ -\left(d/\rho\right)^{2} }
$$
- `\(d\)` is distance
- `\(\rho\)` controls the rate of correlation decay with distance

&lt;img src="01-intro_files/figure-html/gauss-cov-1.png" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Matérn covariance

Flexible, can be exponential or Gaussian shape or other shapes

&lt;img src="01-intro_files/figure-html/matern-plot-1.png" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Matérn covariance

.xsmall[
$$
\mathcal{C} \left(d \right) = \frac{\sigma^2}{2^{\nu - 1}\Gamma(\nu)}
    (\kappa d)^\nu K_\nu \kappa d \quad 😱
$$
]

.xsmall[
- `\(d\)` = distance
- `\(\Gamma\)` = the gamma function
- `\(K_\nu\)` = modified Bessel function of the 2nd kind(!)
- `\(\kappa\)` = decorrelation rate
- `\(\sigma^2\)` = variance
- `\(\nu\)` is fixed at 1 to take advantage of SPDE
]

---

# Matérn covariance range

Range = distance where correlation has decayed&lt;br&gt;to `\(\sim\)` 0.13.

`\(\mathrm{range} = \sqrt{8 \nu} / \kappa\)`, so if `\(\nu = 1\)`, `\(\mathrm{range} = \sqrt{8} / \kappa\)`

# SPDE approach: what you need to know&lt;br&gt;(*and a bit extra in case you find this stuff thrilling* 🤓)

---

# Estimating Gaussian random fields

.small[
Georeferenced data often involve 1000s or more points

We need to approximate the spatial field

Options include nearest neighbor methods, covariance tapering, predictive process models, binning, etc.

sdmTMB uses the SPDE approach from INLA
  * for VAST users, this is the same
  * INLA books:
    &lt;https://www.r-inla.org/learnmore/books&gt;
]

---

# INLA, fmesher, and the SPDE approach

.xsmall[
* SPDE: stochastic partial differential equation
]

--

.xsmall[
* A solution to a specific SPDE allows computing a precision matrix of a Gaussian *Markov* random field (GMRF) that is a good approximation to a Gaussian random field with **Matérn** covariance.
]

--

.xsmall[
* We can estimate this sparse precision matrix efficiently.
]

--

.xsmall[
* In short: the SPDE approach lets us efficiently estimate approximate Gaussian random fields by letting us work with GMRFs and their precision matrix.
]

--

.xsmall[
* INLA/fmesher performs data wrangling for SPDE estimation
  * INLA also performs approximate Bayesian estimation
  * sdmTMB uses fmesher to wrangle matrices, but uses TMB for maximum marginal likelihood estimation

# Introducing meshes

The SPDE approach involves a triangulation over the area of interest; we call this a "mesh" or more accurately a "finite element mesh"

&lt;img src="01-intro_files/figure-html/mesh-example-1.png" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# SPDE matrices (*extra*)

With the mesh, we can calculate 3 sparse matrices needed to calculate the precision matrix `\(\boldsymbol{Q}\)`

$$
\boldsymbol{Q} = \tau^2 \left(\kappa^4\boldsymbol{C_0} + 2\kappa^2\boldsymbol{G}_1 + \boldsymbol{G}_2 \right),
$$

- `\(\boldsymbol{C_0}\)`, `\(\boldsymbol{G_1}\)`, and `\(\boldsymbol{G_2}\)` are these sparse matrices
- `\(\tau\)` scales the precision matrix
- `\(\kappa\)` is the decorrelation rate

---

# Getting back from `\(\tau\)` to variance (*extra*)

.xsmall[
With this precision matrix representation of the Matérn, we need a way of converting from `\(\tau\)` back to variance `\(\sigma^2\)`:
]

.small[
`\(\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{\left (4 \pi \tau^2 \kappa^2 \right)}\)`
]

.xsmall[
`\(\tau\)` and `\(\kappa\)` are parameters from the Matérn precision we will estimate.

Note that `\(\tau\)` is inverse to `\(\sigma\)`.
]

---

# Interpolation from mesh to data (*extra*)

.small[
We usually interpolate from the mesh vertices (the random effects) to any observation or prediction locations using an interpolation (or "projection") matrix.
]

This is often called the "A matrix".

.xsmall[

``` r
loc &lt;- as.matrix(sdmTMB::pcod[,c("X", "Y")])
mesh &lt;- fmesher::fm_mesh_2d(loc = loc, cutoff = 5)
A &lt;- fmesher::fm_basis(mesh, loc = loc)
nrow(loc) # number of data locations
#&gt; [1] 2143
mesh$n # number of mesh vertices
#&gt; [1] 563
dim(A) # interpolation matrix dimensions
#&gt; [1] 2143  563
```
]

---

# Putting it all together (*extra*)

.xsmall[
**Before fitting:**

1. Create a mesh
2. Calculate SPDE matrices
3. Calculate interpolation matrices
]

--

.xsmall[
**Within the model:**

1. Use your SPDE matrices to construct the precision matrix
2. Evaluate the likelihood of the GMRF
3. Project from random effect vertices to the data locations
4. Add in anything else you want (e.g., other parameter effects)
4. Evaluate the data likelihood
5. Project from random effects vertices to any new prediction locations
6. Calculate derived quantities such as range and marginal variance
